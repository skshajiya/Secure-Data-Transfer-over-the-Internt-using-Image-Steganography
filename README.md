# Overview:

This project aims is to implement the Image Steganography for a more secure data transfer, especially over the internet using Least Significant Bit and to develop a system that serves as a security measure by hidden communication to cover a message from third party.

Steganography hides secret data within regular files, like images. It's essential for digital security. Unlike cryptography, which encodes messages, steganography conceals their existence. By embedding data in images, it offers a low-cost way to protect information during transmission. This project creates new encryption methods for hiding messages in images, enhancing digital privacy and security.

## What is Steganography?

Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file.

The word Steganography is derived from two Greek words- ‘stegos’ meaning ‘to cover’ and ‘grayfia’, meaning ‘writing’, thus translating to ‘covered writing’, or ‘hidden writing’. 

The process of hiding information which can be text, image or video inside a cover image is called Steganography.
