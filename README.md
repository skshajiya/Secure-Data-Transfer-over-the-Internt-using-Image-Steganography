# Overview:

This project aims is to implement the Image Steganography for a more secure data transfer, especially over the internet using Least Significant Bit and to develop a system that serves as a security measure by hidden communication to cover a message from third party.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a7dd90c-a687-4801-ac94-c137cf729515)

Steganography hides secret data within regular files, like images. It's essential for digital security. Unlike cryptography, which encodes messages, steganography conceals their existence. By embedding data in images, it offers a low-cost way to protect information during transmission. This project creates new encryption methods for hiding messages in images, enhancing digital privacy and security.

## What is Steganography?

Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file.
